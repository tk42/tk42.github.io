Pandas is a versatile tool for data manipulation in Python, offering multiple functions to combine datasets effectively. 
Recently, I used the `combine` method from pandas.DataFrame for the first time in my many years of programming with Python. 
Although there are numerous online articles about `concat`, `merge`, and `join`, very few discuss `combine`. 
I’m curious as to why this is the case.
Each function—`combine`, `concat`, `merge`, and `join`—serves unique purposes and suits different scenarios. 
In this blog post, we’ll explore these functions, highlight their differences, and guide you on choosing the right method for your data tasks.

# The Combine Function

The `combine` function is less commonly used but incredibly useful for performing element-wise custom operations on two DataFrames with the same shape. It allows for the application of a custom function to two overlapping DataFrames, providing flexibility in handling data with complex logic. This method is ideal when you need to resolve conflicts between data sources by applying specific rules to each element.

```python
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, np.nan, 3], 'B': [4, 5, np.nan]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [5, 6, 7], 'B': [np.nan, 9, 10]})
result = df1.combine(df2, func=lambda s1, s2: s1.fillna(s2))
```
