We gonna talk about the combinatorial purged cross validation method applied to DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) referred to [Combinatorial PurgedKFold Cross-Validation for Deep Reinforcement… – Towards AI](https://towardsai.net/p/l/combinatorial-purgedkfold-cross-validation-for-deep-reinforcement-learning)

# Why we need validation



# Methods

First of all, we're about to describing CPCV (combinatorial purged cross validation) method. Before to explain it, we need quickly to look back to the walk forward method and the cross validation method.
