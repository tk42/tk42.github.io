We gonna talk about the combinatorial purged cross validation method applied to DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) referred to [Combinatorial PurgedKFold Cross-Validation for Deep Reinforcement… – Towards AI](https://towardsai.net/p/l/combinatorial-purgedkfold-cross-validation-for-deep-reinforcement-learning)

# Why we need validation

Dataset especially time series usually has a lot of noises and their trends are difficult to be told. This behavior is so-called as a high SN(signal and noise) ratio. Also, models would be easily overfitted depends on validation methods such as walk-forward method or cross validation method as later. We need to test 

# Methods

First of all, we're about to describing CPCV (combinatorial purged cross validation) method. Before to explain it, we need quickly to look back to the walk forward method and the cross validation method.
